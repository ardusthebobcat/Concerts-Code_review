# CONCERTS - Code Review

##### Helps users organize band-venue pairs, Friday, Aug 28, 2015, Version 1.0

#### By Michael Summers

## Description

_{From the home page, a user can add a venue by clicking the "venue" link and adding in the details about the venue. From the home page, a user can add a band by clicking the "band" link, "add band" button, and adding in the details about the band in the form that appears near the top of the page. The band will then show up on the "Bands List". From there, you can select a band by clicking the band name, or delete it by clicking the "delete button" on the right side [same line]. In the band page, you can select venues that the band has played at, assuming the venues have already been created. }_


## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML (with some css styling between style tags on the layout page), along with Ruby, Sinatra, pry, Rake, etc. The only fairly cool aspect of this project is its increased use of ruby code to hide parts of the page until they are needed. I also implemented (sloppily) a 2-column format on the update_bands page.
